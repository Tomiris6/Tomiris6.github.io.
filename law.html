<h1>Problem</h1>
<center><p>
 Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan have developed or are developing laws aimed at creating a safe environment for women. However, according to experts and
activists, they are aimed more at protecting family values and preserving the family than at preventing violence and protecting women's rights.Also, when filing a complaint with
the police, the victim faces difficulty because, according to the law, it isimpossible to be tried twice for the same offence. In order to file a report, the victim must gather
evidence of her case in secret from her abuser, undergo a forensic examination, and provide at least three facts of the beating on her body

    <h2>Kazakhstan</h2>
 <p> Since the beginning of 2020, the country has the updated
On the Prevention of Domestic Violence". It contains the main measures that the government agencies should take to prevent violence and coordinate the actions of local executive authorities, police and healthcare workers. it provides for the eviction of the abuser, but if he has no other housing, then he is allowed to keep living with
his family. Another corrective action is preventive conversations, protective orders, a ban on communication with the victim and the use of alcohol and drugs.

<h2> Tajikistan </h2>
<p>
 Tajikistan has had a law "On the Prevention of Domestic Violence" in place since 2013. According to the law, the first time a rapist is reported, the rapist is given a
protective order prohibiting any violent acts against the victim for up to 15 days. On a second detention, the rapist is administratively detained for 15 days, and there is a
fine for violating the requirements of the injunction. But just as in Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, the law does not criminalize domestic violence.

<h2>Kyrgyzstan</h2>
<p>
 Compared to other countries in the region, Kyrgyzstan's law against domestic violence is considered more progressive. Whereas before law enforcement only took action when
the victim reported the incident, with the adoption of the 2017 law "On Protection and Protection from Domestic Violence," they counteract violence when a witness to the
violence or a health care provider reports it. Also under the law, a protection order is issued for three days (renewable for a month), which prohibits the abuser from having
contact with the victim. In addition to punishment, the law also provides for a mandatory, state-sponsored intervention program for rapists.

<h2> Uzbekistan </h2>
<p>
 Until 2019, Uzbekistan remained a country where the law did not protect victims of domestic violence. In 2019, the Law on Guarantees of Equal Rights and Opportunities for
Women and Men and the Law on the Protection of Women from Harassment and Violence were passed. The former states that gender discrimination is unacceptable in different areas
and clarifies a number of terms regarding gender equality. According to the second law, victims of domestic violerce receive assistance from law enforcement agencies, free
economic, social, psychological, medical and legal assistance in the centers or through a free hotline.
